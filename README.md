# snake-cpp
this is a basic recreation of the game snake
this program is a console version of the popular snake video game project. 
the project is very basic and is open for revision. one of the main functionality problems that could use work is
the logic for deciding when the user has run into a wall or a part of the snake body. it has semi sucessfull results but is 
quick to end the game if you eat a food source that is next to the wall.
